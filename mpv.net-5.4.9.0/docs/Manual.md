About
-----

mpv.net is a modern desktop media player for Windows based on the popular mpv player.

mpv.net is designed to be mpv compatible, almost all mpv features are available
because they are all contained in libmpv, this means the official
[mpv manual](https://mpv.io/manual/master/) applies to mpv.net.

mpv focuses on the usage of the command line and the terminal,
mpv.net retains the ability to be used from the command line and
the terminal and adds a modern Windows GUI on top of it.

[Changelog](Changelog.md)


### Stable

[Release page](../../../releases)


### Beta

[OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArwKS_ZUR01g1ldoLA90tX9DzKTj?e=xITXbC)

[DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t54p9igdwvllbpl/AADKyWpaFnIhdyosxyP5d3_xa?dl=0)


Installation
------------

mpv.net requires the .NET Framework 4.8 and Windows 7 or 10 and a modern graphics card.

There is a setup exe and a portable zip file download.

For internet streaming youtube-dl must be downloaded and installed manually,
meaning it must be located in the PATH environment variable or in the startup directory.

mpvnet.exe is platform agnostic, users that need x86 have to replace 4 native tools:

- Everything.dll
- mpv-1.dll
- MediaInfo.dll
- mpvnet.com


#### File Associations

File Associations can be created using the context menu under 'Tools > Setup'.

After the file associations were registered, go to the Windows settings under
'Settings > Apps > Default apps' or shell execute `ms-settings:defaultapps` and choose
mpv.net as default app for Video and optionally for Audio and Images.

It's possible to change the default application using the 'Open with' feature
of the context menu in File Explorer.

[Open with++](#open-with) can be used to extend the File Explorer context menu
to get menu items for [Play with mpv.net](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#play-with-mpvnet) and
[Add to mpv.net playlist](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#add-to-mpvnet-playlist).

When multiple files are selected in File Explorer and enter is pressed then
the files are opened in mpv.net in random order, this works with maximum 15 files.


Support
-------

Before making a support request, please try a newer [beta version](#beta) first.

Bugs and feature requests can be made on the github [issue tracker](../../../issues),
feel free to use for anything mpv.net related, usage questions are welcome.

Or use the [support thread](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/392514-mpv-net-a-extendable-media-player-for-windows) in the VideoHelp forum.


Settings
--------

mpv.net searches the config folder at:

1. startup\portable_config
2. %APPDATA%\mpv.net

In order to use a custom directory create following file:

startup\settings-directory.txt

Put your custom directory in that file.

The custom directory path can be relative to the startup directory path.

This custom directory is only used if the portable_config and %APPDATA% directory does not exist.

mpv specific settings are stored in the file mpv.conf, if no mpv.conf file exists
mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

[mpv.conf defaults](../../../tree/master/src/Resources/mpv.conf.txt)

mpv.net specific settings are stored in the file mpvnet.conf,
these options are documented [here](#mpvnet-specific-options).


Input and context menu
----------------------

The input (key/mouse) bindings and the context menu definitions are stored in the
input.conf file, if it's missing mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

[input.conf defaults](../../../tree/master/src/Resources/input.conf.txt)

Global hotkeys are supported via global-input.conf file.

The config folder can be opened from the context menu: `Settings > Open Config Folder`


Command Line Interface
----------------------

**mpvnet** [options] [file|URL|PLAYLIST|-]  
**mpvnet** [options] files


mpv properties can be set with the same syntax as mpv, that is:


To enable the border property:

`--border` or `--border=yes`


To disable the border property:

`--no-boder` or `--border=no`


Supported are all mpv properties, they are documented here:

https://mpv.io/manual/master/#properties


mpv.net has a feature to list all properties:

_Context Menu > View > Show Properties_


Non property switches are generally not supported in mpv.net!


Terminal
--------

When mpv.net is started from a terminal it will output status,
error and debug messages to the terminal and accept input keys from the terminal.

In the context menu under _Tools > Setup_ a button can be found to add
mpv.net to the path environment variable.

A common task for the terminal is debugging scripts.


mpv.net specific options
------------------------

mpv.net specific options can be found in the conf editor searching for 'mpv.net'.

The options are saved in the mpvnet.conf file.

#### --queue \<files\>

Adds files to the playlist, requires [--process-instance=single](#--process-instancevalue).
[Open with++](#open-with) can be used to add files to the playlist using File Explorer.

#### --command=\<input command\>

Sends a input command. Useful to control mpv.net from the command line, for instance
to create global hotkeys with AutoHotkey, for that [process-instance=single](#--process-instancevalue)
must be used. Spaces have to be escaped with quotes and quotes have to be escaped with double quotes.

### Audio

External Tools
--------------

### Play with mpv

In order to play videos from sites such as YouTube the Chrome Extension [Play with mpv](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/play-with-mpv/hahklcmnfgffdlchjigehabfbiigleji) can be used.

Due to Chrome Extensions not being able to start a app, another app that communicates with the extension is required, this app can be downloaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/lezj8lwqt5zf75v/play-with-mpvnet-server.7z/file). The extension works only when the app is running, to have the app always running a link can be created in the auto start folder located at:

`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

This will start the app on system start and have it running in the background. When the file association registration of mpv.net was executed then the app should find the location of mpv.net, alternativly the mpv.net folder can be added to the Path environment variable.


### Open With

Alternatively the Chrome/Firefox extension [Open With](../../../issues/119) can be used.


### Open with++

[Open with++](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus) can be used to extend the File Explorer context menu to get menu items for [Play with mpv.net](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#play-with-mpvnet) and [Add to mpv.net playlist](https://github.com/stax76/OpenWithPlusPlus#add-to-mpvnet-playlist).


Scripting
---------

#### Lua

File Type: `lua`

Location: `<config folder>\scripts`

The Lua script host is built into libmpv.

There is no debugging support, only error and debug messages printed on the terminal.

Lua scripts are loaded before the first media file loads.

[mpv Lua documentation](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#lua-scripting)

[mpv user scripts](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts)


#### JavaScript

File Type: `js`

Location: `<config folder>\scripts`

The JavaScript script host is built into libmpv.

There is no debugging support, only error and debug messages printed on the terminal.

JavaScript scripts are loaded before the first media file loads.

[mpv JavaScript documentation](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#javascript)

[mpv user scripts](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts)


#### PowerShell

File Type: `ps1`

Location: `<config folder>\scripts-ps`

The PowerShell scripting host is like extensions not
initialized before media files are loaded.

mpv.net does not define scripting interfaces but instead exposed
its complete internals, there are no compatibility guaranties.

[Example Scripts](../../../tree/master/src/Scripts)


#### C#

File Type: `cs`

Location: `<config folder>\scripts-cs`

mpv.net does not define scripting interfaces but instead exposed
its complete internals, there are no compatibility guaranties.

Script code can be written within a C# [extension](../../../tree/master/src/Extensions),
that way full code completion and debugger support is available.
Once the code was developed and debugged, it can be moved
from the extension to a lightweight standalone script.

The C# scripting host is like [extensions](../../../tree/master/src/Extensions)
not initialized before media files are loaded.

[Example Scripts](../../../tree/master/src/Scripts)


Extensions
----------

Extensions are located in a subfolder _extensions_ in the config folder
and the filename must have the same name as the directory:

```Text
<config folder>\extensions\ExampleExtension\ExampleExtension.dll
```

mpv.net does not define extension interfaces but instead exposed
its complete internals, there are no compatibility guaranties.


### Walkthrough creating an extension

- Download and install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).
- Create a new project of type **Class Library .NET Framework**
  and ensure the project name ends with **Extension**.
- Add a reference to **System.ComponentModel.Composition**.
- Add a reference to mpvnet.exe, select the mpvnet reference
  in the Solution Explorer, open the Properties window and set
  **Copy Local** to false to prevent mpvnet.exe being copied
  to the output directory when the project is built.
- Now open the project properties and set the output path in the Build tab,
  extensions are like scripts located in your config folder, example:
  `<config folder>\extensions\ExampleExtension\ExampleExtension.dll`
- Also in the project properties choose the option **Start external program**
  in the Debug tab and define the path to mpvnet.exe. In the Debug tab you may also
  define command line arguments like a video file to be played when you start debugging.


### Sample Code

#### RatingExtension

This extension writes a rating to the filename of rated videos when mpv.net shuts down.

The input.conf defaults contain key bindings for this extension to set ratings.

[Source Code](../../../tree/master/src/Extensions)


Color Theme
-----------

mpv.net supports custom color themes, the definition of the built-in themes can be found at:

[theme.txt](../../../tree/master/src/Resources/theme.txt)


Custom themes can be saved at:

`<conf folder>\theme.conf`

The theme.conf file may contain an unlimited amount of themes.

In the config editor under UI there are the settings dark-theme and
light-theme to define the themes used in dark and in light mode.


Advanced Features
-----------------

### Playback of VapourSynth scripts

vpy files are supported with following mpv.conf configuration:

```
[extension.vpy]
demuxer-lavf-format = vapoursynth
```

Python and VapourSynth must be in the path environment variable.


Hidden Features
---------------

Selecting multiple files in File Explorer and pressing enter will
open the files in mpv.net. Explorer restricts this to maximum 15 files
and the order will be random.

Whenever the control key is pressed when files or URLs are opened,
the playlist is not cleared but the files or URLs are appended to the playlist.
This works in all mpv.net features that open files or URLs.

Pressing the shift key while opening a single file will suppress loading
all files of the folder into the playlist.

In fullscreen mode clicking the top right corner closes the player.


Differences compared to mpv
---------------------------

mpv.net is designed to work exactly like mpv, there are a few limitations:


### Window Limitations

mpv.net implements an own main window which means only mpv window
features are supported that have an own implementation in mpv.net.

A window free mode is currently not supported, the main window is always
visible, even when mpv.net is started from the terminal and music is played.

The documentation of mpvs window features can be found here:

https://mpv.io/manual/master/#window


mpv.net has currently implemented the following window features:

- [border](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-border)
- [fullscreen](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-fullscreen)
- [ontop](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-ontop)
- [screen](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-screen)
- [title](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-title)
- [window-maximized](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-window-maximized)
- [window-minimized](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-window-minimized)


**Partly implemented are:**

[autofit](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-autofit)

[autofit-smaller](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-autofit-smaller)

[autofit-larger](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-autofit-larger)


### Command Line Limitations

mpv.net supports property based mpv command line options which means it supports
almost all mpv command line options.

What is not supported are non property bases options. Non property based options
need an own implementation in mpv.net, so far implemented are:

--ad=help  
--audio-device=help  
--input-keylist  
--profile=help  
--vd=help  
--version  


### mpv.net specific options

Options that are specific to mpv.net can be found by entering _mpv.net_
in the search field of the config editor, in the manual they are documented
[here](#mpvnet-specific-options).

mpv.net specific options are saved in the file mpvnet.conf and are just
as mpv properties available on the command line.


Technical Overview
------------------

mpv.net is written in C# 7 and runs on the .NET Framework 4.8.

The Extension implementation is based on the
[Managed Extensibility Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/).

The main window is WinForms based because WinForms allows better libmpv integration
compared to WPF, all other windows are WPF based.

The config editor adds it's controls dynamically and uses
[TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) to define it's content.


Third party components are:

- [libmpv provides the core functionality](https://mpv.io/)
- [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)
- [Tommy, a single file TOML parser](https://github.com/dezhidki/Tommy)
- [Everything, a fast file search service](https://www.voidtools.com)


Context Menu
------------

The context menu of mpv.net is defined in the file input.conf which is
located in the config directory.

If the input.conf file does not exists mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/tree/master/src/Resources/input.conf.txt>

input.conf defines mpvs key and mouse bindings and mpv.net uses
comments to define the context menu.


### Open > Open Files

The Open Files menu entry is one way to open files in mpv.net, it supports multi selection.

Another way to open files is the command line which is used by
File Explorer for existing associations.

A third way is to drag and drop files on the main window.

Whenever the control key is pressed when files or URLs are opened,
the playlist is not cleared but the files or URLs are appended to the
playlist. This works in all mpv.net features that open files or URLs.

Pressing the shift key while opening a single file will suppress loading all files in the folder.

Blu-ray and DVD ISO image files are supported.


### Open > Open URL or file path from clipboard

Opens files and URLs from the clipboard. How to open URLs directly
from the browser from sites like YouTube is described in the
[External Tools section](#external-tools).

For internet streaming youtube-dl must be downloaded and installed manually,
meaning it must be located in the PATH environment variable or in the startup directory.

### Open > Open DVD/Blu-ray Drive/Folder

Opens a DVD/Blu-ray Drive/Folder.


### Open > Show media search

mpv.net supports system wide media searches using the Everything indexing
service installed by the popular file search tool [Everything](www.voidtools.com).


### Open > Load external audio files

Allows to load an external audio file. It's also possible to auto detect
external audio files based on the file name, the option for this can be
found in the settings under 'Settings > Show Config Editor > Audio > audio-file-auto'.


### Open > Load external subtitle files

Allows to load an external subtitle file. It's also possible to auto detect
external subtitle files based on the file name, the option for this can be
found in the settings under 'Settings > Show Config Editor > Subtitles > sub-auto'.


### Play/Pause

Play/Pause using the command:

`cycle pause`

[cycle command](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#command-interface-cycle-%3Cname%3E-[%3Cvalue%3E])

[pause property](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-pause)
